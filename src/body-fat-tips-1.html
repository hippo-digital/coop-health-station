            <h1>Risks of elevated or high body fat</h1>

                <h2>What is overfat?</h2>

                <p>Overfat is a term created to describe if you have a body fat level that can actually hurt your health. Even people who are considered "normal weight" or "non-obese" by traditional standards can fall into this category.</p>

            <p>The authors of this new study argue that BMI misses about 50% of the people who still have dangerous amounts of fat. Those are typically people who have the proverbial beer belly, but are otherwise in decent shape.</p>
                    <p>"We shouldn't be as much worried about weight," said author Paul Laursen, an adjunct professor and performance physiologist at the Sports Performance Research Institute in New Zealand. Your scale or that BMI calculator don't know that you could be an athlete and have a lot of muscle mass, or a growing teen. Or, you could have gone on a fad diet and lost 3 pounds, but that doesn't necessarily make you healthier -- that 3 pounds could merely have been water weight, he said. "What we should really be worried about is the fat part and where your fat is concentrated."</p>

                <h2>Why's belly fat so bad</h2>

                <p>Abdominal fat is one of the most dangerous kinds of fat you can have. The reason it's so bad is that unlike your love handles -- which are the pinchable fat right beneath your skin -- the fat that is in your stomach area grows deep inside your body and it wraps around your vital organs. Your liver borrows this fat and turns it into cholesterol that can sneak into your arteries and start collecting there. When it collects, your arteries start to harden, and when they get hard, this can lead you to having a heart attack or stroke. </p>
